Were you trying to write something?)*\n- **Send code if relevant.** *(Ex. if the error is a code error, send the code.)*\n- **Send the full error.** *(This can either be a screenshot of the **full error** (please tell us the libraries you use if so), or you can copy it from the error screen. Please put it in a codeblock.)*\n\nBefore asking for help, *please* try figuring it out yourself. Everyone who helps are people volunteering their free time, and we can't answer every small question."
