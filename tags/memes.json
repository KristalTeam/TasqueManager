This is a fancy way of saying that clutter such as irrelevant memes and low-effort jokes are not allowed.\n\nWhile some servers have meme channels as a sort of \"containment\" method, they are difficult to moderate, often times only posted in by people who do not contribute to the server outside of it, and generally add no value to the server.\n\nHowever, if you feel something is relevant, PLEASE think about whether it's worth sending or not.\n\nWe do not want to be the \"joke police\". However, we have a responsibility to keep chat friendly, respectful and worth being in. We want people to feel comfortable chatting here."
