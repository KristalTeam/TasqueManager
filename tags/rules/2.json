If someone asks for a Discord invite somewhere, please ask a mod first before posting it. We have a filter which will block invites.\n- Messages and conversations should be constructive. Avoid posting irrelevant memes, low-effort jokes, or other content that clutters the chat. Keep discussions meaningful and respectful of everyone’s time.\n- Please keep messages in English. We know this can be limiting, but our moderation team only speaks English.\n- Avoid political, emotionally charged, or sensitive topics. There are better places for these discussions, and they often aren’t constructive here. Do not joke about these topics either.\n- Do not use typing “quirks,” Unicode “fonts” (e.g., 𝓵𝓲𝓴𝓮 𝓽𝓱𝓲𝓼), Wingdings, exclusively post in “footers,” or any other formatting that makes messages harder to read or less accessible.\n- Do not roleplay, and do not impersonate. You are not Spamton, Gaster, or Toby Fox. Writing dialogue as a clear joke is okay, but any sort of serious attempt at roleplay is prohibited."
